# MEK4250: oblig 01, Ottar Hellan
Mandatory exercise one for MEK4250/9250 by Ottar Hellan.

Scripts to run the numerical experiments are contained in the main directory and import the necessary functionality from neighboring files and folders. Options like mesh characteristic length, time step size, and element types are chosen by modifying variables in each scripts ``main()`` function.

In each file containing the necessary functionality, there is some testing code in the files ``main()`` function. These may not run without modifying the main directory to the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment-variable, due to how they import files from neighboring folders.
